Prerequisites
-------------

-   Complete the in-class assignments (Pokemon Data Extractor, Pokemon Class, Player Class)

-   Have a working get_pokemon_data() function

-   Have a working Pokemon class with info() method

Homework Assignment: Build the Pokemon Hunting System
-----------------------------------------------------

### Task

Implement the Pokemon hunting system where players can find and catch Pokemon.

### Requirements

Add these methods to your PokemonGame class:

```python
import  random

def  go_hunting(self):

    """
    Player encounters a random wild Pokemon (ID 1-151)
    and can choose to catch or flee
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE - Part 1: Generate Wild Pokemon
    # 1. Generate a random Pokemon ID between 1 and 151
    # 2. Use get_pokemon_data() to fetch the Pokemon info
    # 3. Create a Pokemon object from the data
    # 4. Store it in self.wild_pokemon
    # YOUR CODE HERE - Part 2: Encounter Menu
    # Display: "A wild {pokemon_name} appeared!"
    # Show the Pokemon's info using pokemon.info()
    # Show options: "1. Try to catch  2. Flee"
    # Get user input and call appropriate method
    pass

def  try_catch_pokemon(self):
    """
    Attempt to catch the wild Pokemon
    Base catch rate: 25%
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # 1. Calculate catch probability (base rate: 25%)
    # 2. Generate random number (0-1)
    # 3. If successful:
    #    - Add Pokemon to player's collection
    #    - Clear wild_pokemon
    #    - Show success message
    # 4. If failed:
    #    - Show failure message
    # 5. Show the catch probability for debugging
    pass

def  remove_pokemon_menu(self):
    """Allow player to remove Pokemon from their collection"""
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #  1.  Show  current  collection  using  player.show_collection()
    # 2. Get user input for which Pokemon to remove
    # hint: make sure to convert input number to a proper index (1 -> 0)
    # 3. Call player.remove_pokemon() with the index
    # 4. Handle invalid input gracefully
    pass
```

### Expected Behavior

```python
Welcome  to  Pokemon  CLI  Adventure!
What's  your  name,  trainer?  Ash

Hello  Ash!  Time  to  choose  your  starter  Pokemon!

Choose  your  starter  Pokemon:
1.  Bulbasaur  (Grass  type)
2.  Charmander  (Fire  type)
3.  Squirtle  (Water  type)
Enter  1,  2,  or  3:  2

Charmander  added  to  Ash's  collection!
You  chose  Charmander!  Great  choice!

===  Pokemon  Adventure  -  Ash  ===
1.  Go  hunting  (find  wild  Pokemon)
2.  View  your  collection
3.  Remove  Pokemon  from  collection
4.  Quit  game

What  would  you  like  to  do?  1

You  go  hunting  for  Pokemon...

A  wild  Pidgey  appeared!
Pidgey  (ID:  16)
   HP:  40
   Attack:  45
   Type:  normal
   Sprite:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/16.png

1.  Try  to  catch
2.  Flee

What  do  you  want  to  do?  1

You  throw  a  Pokeball...
Catch  rate:  25.0%
Gotcha!  Pidgey  was  caught!
Pidgey  added  to  Ash's  collection!
```

### Implementation Hints

#### For go_hunting():

-   Use random.randint(1, 151) to generate random Pokemon IDs

-   Check if get_pokemon_data() returns valid data before creating Pokemon object

-   Handle the case where API request fails gracefully

-   Use input() to get user choice and convert to integer

-   Call try_catch_pokemon() or handle fleeing based on user input

#### For try_catch_pokemon():

-   Base catch rate is 25% (0.25)

-   Use random.random() to generate a number between 0 and 1

-   If random number ≤ catch rate, the catch is successful

-   Remember to check if player's collection is full before adding Pokemon

-   Clear self.wild_pokemon after successful catch or flee

#### For remove_pokemon_menu():

-   Show the collection first so user knows what's available

-   Get user input for which Pokemon to remove (1-based indexing)

-   Convert to 0-based index for the remove_pokemon() method

-   Handle invalid input (non-numbers, out-of-range numbers)
